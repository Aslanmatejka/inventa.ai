Product Visual Knowledge — How Products Actually LOOK

Comprehensive visual/structural knowledge that teaches the AI what real products
look like, how they're shaped, what proportions make them recognizable, and how
to build them in CadQuery. This module augments the product library with deep
visual understanding.

Three types of knowledge per product/category:
  1. visual_profile  — What the product looks like from every angle. Shape language,
                        silhouette, cross-sections, surface character, proportions.
  2. build_strategy  — CadQuery-specific construction recipe. Step-by-step approach
                        to building this product in code.
  3. recognition_features — The 3-5 things that make this product instantly recognizable.
                           If these are wrong, the model looks "off". These are non-negotiable.
